DeadManSwitch
=============

DeadManSwitch is an electronic dead man's switch that will send notifications, to recipients you specify, if you don't check in.

I can't always use the latest technologies on projects I'm paid to work on, so I use this as a practical application to stay current on new technologies. I gain a deeper understanding of the technologies by applying them to a real application.
